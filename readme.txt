Potion Mod

Mision statement:
Make potions into a rewarding skill used throughout the game instead of last resorts.

Potential Problems:
Balance; if the game doesn't require potions to win how do you make them more powerful
and maintain balnce

Clutter; many potions takes up many inventory slots especially if you hoard ingredients

Materials; you only find so much of each material in each playthorugh and with mods
that add more items it can be hard to find specific items.

Incentive; if potions are a limited resource what is the incentive to use them when
you are capable of beating enemies without them


Ideas:
Small but permenant stat buff. This would create a clear incentive to make and drink potions
constantly as well as compensate fo lack of materials

Use fruit, gems, and mushrooms as main ingredients. These can be found much more commonly if the
player choses to take the respective class or craft the fruit staff.

A secondary withdrawal timer with each potion. Drinking more potions would reset the timer 
giving a reason to be constantly chugging potions.

Brewmaster skill grant bonuses when consuming potion.
